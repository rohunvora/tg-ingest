## Usage

```

This logs into YOUR Telegram account. You'll receive a code in your Telegram app.

### 2. Quick Export (NEW! üöÄ)

**Option A: Web UI** (Easiest)
```bash
./run.sh web
```
Opens a simple local web interface to:
- Export last 1h, 6h, 24h or custom time
- Auto-clean for AI analysis
- Download history

**Option B: Command Line** (Fastest)
```bash
# One-click export last hour
./quick1h.sh https://t.me/c/123456789/12345

# Or specify hours
./run.sh quick

# Filter by username
./run.sh quick --chat-url "https://t.me/c/123456789/12345" --hours 6 --username YOUR_USERNAME
```

**Option C: Direct to AI** (Copy to clipboard)
```bash
# Mac - exports and copies to clipboard
./quick1h.sh https://t.me/c/123456789/12345

# Now just paste into Claude/ChatGPT!
```

### 3. Full Export (for archival)

```bash
# Export all messages
poetry run tg_export dump --chat-url "https://t.me/c/123456789" --out my_archive.jsonl

# Export only your messages
poetry run tg_export dump --chat-url "https://t.me/c/123456789" --out my_messages.jsonl --username YOUR_USERNAME

# Export last 24 hours from specific user
poetry run tg_export dump --chat-url "https://t.me/c/123456789" --out filtered.jsonl --last 24h --username THEIR_USERNAME
```

## Output Format

Messages are saved in clean, AI-ready format:
```
[2025-06-26 14:32] username: message text
